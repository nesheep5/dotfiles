==> Caveats
Note: When using launchctl the port will be 8080.

To have launchd start jenkins at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/jenkins/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load jenkins now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.jenkins.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
    jenkins
